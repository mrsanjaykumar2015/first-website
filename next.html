        <h3>What can I expect at a weekend service?</h3>
        <p>Newbreak is a "come-as-you-are" church meaning you don't need to dress up or dress down, look or behave a 
            certain way, or meet some expectation before you're welcome. We want to get to know the real YOU! When you
             arrive at any of our campuses, you will be greeted by friendly faces wearing Newbreak t-shirts who can direct
              you to where to go to check in your kids, grab a cup of coffee, and find a seat. Weekend services are about 75
               minutes long and usually begin when you hear the live music starting. Song lyrics are projected onto the screens
                so you can sing along and/or engage with worship however you feel most comfortable. After the music, there is a 
                brief time of announcements and receiving the weekend's offering, after which one of our pastors will come out to
                 share a practical message about Jesus. Click on the "Watch" menu above to check out videos of our sermons.</p>

        <h3>What happens during the week?</h3>
        <p>During the week, we have the opportunity to develop deep relationships with others by spending time together in smaller
             communities we call Life Groups. Meeting in homes and locations throughout the city, these groups are made up of about a
              dozen or so individuals who are studying a particular topic or book (such as a Book of the Bible, a book on practices like
               prayer or parenting); navigating a similar life season (moms, newly-marrieds, empty-nesters, divorce, addiction recovery, 
               etc); or share interests in activities that bring them together (such as surfing or biking). Our desire is for everyone to
                be in a Life Group, so we have midweek programs for kids and students as well as adults! Check out the "Groups" menu above 
                for more information.</p>

        <h3>How do you care for my community?</h3>
        <p>Serving communities is part of our mission here at Newbreak and we do that both here in San Diego and in countries throughout
             the world. Locally, many of our campuses work with schools in their communities to provide support and much-needed resources
              for teachers and students alike. We also partner with local organizations who specifically help under-resourced individuals,
               homeless communities, and local refugees. Across the border in Mexico, we partner with organizations to build houses, provide
                medical clinics and support orphans and children in need. Throughout the world, clean drinking water is a right many are denied
                 and we work with organizations remedying this. All are welcome to join us and you can find more information by clicking on the 
                 "Events" menu above.</p>
