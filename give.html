    <div class="about">
        <h3>Tithing is our foundation for giving as it demonstrates our faithfulness and obedience. Kingdom Builders offerings allow us to fund the people and projects bringing the life-changing gift of God's grace to their world.</h3>
        <p>The Bible teaches us a baseline standard for giving: the tithe. When we give the first 10% of our gross income to our local church, we put God first in our lives. When we give over and above to Kingdom Builder offerings, we demonstrate practical love for others and  get a front-row seat in advancing God's Kingdom. Scripture teaches that the tithe belongs to God (<a href="#">Leviticus 27:30</a>) That is why when we fail to tithe, we rob God of that which rightfully belongs to Him (<a href="#">Malachi 3:8-9</a>) Stewardship refers to the fact that God made us managers, not owners. Everything we have belongs to God. “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it” (<a href="#">Psalm 24:1</a>) When God created humans, He placed them in a position of managing the earth, not owning it (<a href="#">Genesis 2:15</a>) Understanding this is foundational to the practice of tithing because once we appreciate that God owns everything, it flows that we would return to God a portion of what He has given us.</p>
